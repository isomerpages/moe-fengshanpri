<p>For the past few years, an Education Career&nbsp;Talk&nbsp;was organised for P6 pupils after the PSLE exam to introduce them to the various careers out there and set their minds thinking about achieving their dreams and ambitions for the future. During the session, the pupils mingled with special speakers from&nbsp;specially invited industries partners.
