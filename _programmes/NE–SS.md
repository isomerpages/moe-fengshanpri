<h4><strong>NATIONAL EDUCATION</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>Our Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To develop culturally flexible students committed to the needs of our school and country.</p>
<p>Needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>contributing to the success of school and country</li>
<li>pride of being a Fengshanian and Singaporean</li>
<li>loyalty to school and country</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Our Vision</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>Total Defence Day</strong></h4>
<p>Total Defence Day is commemorated on 15 Feb every year. This almost mirrors the exact situation on 15 Feb 1942 when Japanese took over Singapore, as that day was the first day of the Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>Fengshan Primary School commemorated Total Defence Day based on the theme &lsquo;Together We Keep Singapore Strong&rsquo;. Display boards with information on the Five Pillars of Our Defence, were put up at the small void deck for pupils to peruse during their recesses. Hardships of life under the Japanese Occupation were also highlighted to commemorate the day Singapore surrendered to the Japanese 76 years ago.</p>
<p>During the commemoration, pupils were reminded of the hardship our forefathers went through. Through videos and information shared, every pupil was reminded that they have a role to play in Total Defence in order for Singapore to prosper and progress with racial harmony and strong community bonding.</p>
