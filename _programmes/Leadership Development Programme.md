<h4><strong>LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME for P2 to P6 Prefects</strong></h4>
<img style="width: 35%;" src="/images/ldp.jpg" align = "right" />
<p>The Leadership Development Programme is formulated as part of our efforts to raise the quality of pupil leaders. The Prefects go through structured and progressive training as they learn self-management, relationship management, conflict management and problem-solving skills for PERSONAL, PEER and PEOPLE leadership development. Prefects practise their leadership skills daily as they lead their classes and the school population as good role-models.</p>
<p>Through the leadership programme, the Primary 2 Prefects learn self-management leadership skills and understanding their leadership styles. The Primary 3 programme focuses on achieving inter-personal effectiveness through effective communication skills. Prefects in P4 focus on the importance of managing conflicts and building friendships. Primary 5 &amp; 6 Prefects focus on project management skills and effective presentation skills. Prefects, as change agents in the school, then participate in School Improvement projects and participate in the &ldquo;Be the Change&rdquo; competition and lead in planning and implementing school events and create greater impact as LEADERS of TOMORROW.</p>
