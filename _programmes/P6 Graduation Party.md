<p>The Primary Six pupils had their graduation party on after PSLE. The pupils participated in games on friendship, watched their friends perform and ended the day with a sumptuous meal.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll miss you P6s and all the best as you move on to your choice Secondary schools next year&hellip;.</p>
