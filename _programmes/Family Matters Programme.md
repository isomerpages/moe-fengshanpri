<p>Fengshan works closely with MSF to run the Family Matters&nbsp;programme to encourage family unity and foster love, care and concern for family members. Some of the activities organised yearly include Movie nights, visits to the Botantic Gardens, Night Safari&nbsp;and Pizza making sessions. Interactive workshops are also organized for families on topics of interest, like Cyber-wellness, Character Development Parents&rsquo; Toolkit&nbsp;and&nbsp;Promoting Champion Mindset.</p>
