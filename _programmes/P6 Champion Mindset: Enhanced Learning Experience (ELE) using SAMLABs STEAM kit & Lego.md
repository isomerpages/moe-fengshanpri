<p>P6 pupils had the opportunity to have a hands-on experience to explore the basics of coding and its processes using the SamLabs system. The project was on the topic of creating a smart school, smart nation or a smart community. By the end of the course, pupils were able to apply the &ldquo;Designs thinking&rdquo; approach as they put their learning together and used their imagination to create a SMART and innovative reality in line with the theme.&nbsp; Through the project, the pupils demonstrated the &ldquo;Can-Do&rdquo; spirit, picked up coding, computational and design engineering as well as public speaking skills.</p>
