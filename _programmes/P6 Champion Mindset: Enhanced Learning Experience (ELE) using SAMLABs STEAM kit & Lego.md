<p>P6 pupils had the opportunity to have a hands-on experience to explore
the basics of coding and its processes using the SamLabs system. The project
was on the topic of creating a smart school, smart nation or a smart community.
By the end of the course, pupils were able to apply the “Designs thinking”
approach as they put their learning together and used their imagination
to create a SMART and innovative reality in line with the theme.&nbsp;
Through the project, the pupils demonstrated the “Can-Do” spirit, picked
up coding, computational and design engineering as well as public speaking
skills.</p>
