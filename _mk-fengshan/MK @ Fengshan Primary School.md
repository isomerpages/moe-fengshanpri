<p>We are pleased to share with you that MOE will be setting up an MOE Kindergarten (MK) within Fengshan Primary School. The MK at Fengshan Primary School will enroll Kindergarten 1 (K1) children from January 2023.</p>
<p>MOE has been running MKs since 2014 to provide <strong><em>A Strong Start for Every Child</em></strong>. The MK Curriculum nurtures children holistically so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy. To date, there are 28 MKs across Singapore, with another 8 MKs starting operations each year in January 2021 and 2022.</p>
