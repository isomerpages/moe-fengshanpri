<h2>2024 MOE Kindergarten</h2>
<p>Welcome to MOE Kindergarten @ Fengshan Primary (MK@FP)! We opened our
doors and hearts to children and their families with our first batch of
Kindergarten 1 students in January 2023. We have grown since then and are
providing quality education to both K1 and K2 children.</p>
<p>Here at MK@FP, we are a team of Brave Hearts who strive with resilience
and compassion to nurture every child to be curious Little Champions who
are responsible and respectful towards their families, their school and
the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When children join MK@FP they embark on an inspirational learning journey
through our two flagship programmes â€“ the HI-Light Programme and the Starlight
Bilingual Literacy Programme for English Language (EL) and Mother Tongue
Languages (MTL). Through these programmes, our team of professional educators
nurture children holistically so that they can be confident, demonstrate
strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.</p>
<p>MK@FP also provides before and after Kindergarten care (KCare) services
for children enrolled in our MK.</p>
<p>Take a peek into our MK programmes</p>
