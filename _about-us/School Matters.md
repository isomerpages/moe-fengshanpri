<h2>Dismissal Procedures for School</h2>
<h4>Dismissal Procedures for P1 and P2 Pupils</h4>
<p>To ensure that P1 and P2 pupils reach home safely after school, we require
an adult to pick them up after school if they are not taking the school
bus. All P1/2 dismissal will be done via Gate 3. As such, the <u>Main Gate (Gate 2) and Gate 1 will be closed from 1.20 pm to 1.30 pm (Mon/Tues/Thurs/Fri) and from 1.05 pm to 1.15 pm (Wed)</u>.
No cars or visitors will leave or enter the premise via the main gate during
this period. For the safety of pupils, we seek your cooperation to avoid
coming into the school premises during the dismissal timings. Do move forward
towards Gate 3 only when your child’s/ward’s class is announced by our
staff or when you see the class placard being held up by our staff as an
indication for you to move forward. If you arrive after the dismissal of
your child’s/ward’s class, please wait for further instructions before
moving towards the gate. This will help to decongest the area as well as
ensure the safe and orderly dismissal of our students.</p>
<h4>Dismissal Procedures for P3 to P6 Pupils</h4>
<p>All P3 to P6 pupils will be dismissed via the Gate 1 or 2 as indicated
in the dismissal timings on page 5. Pupils waiting for their siblings are
to wait at designated tables in the canteen. To ensure pupils leave the
school premises smoothly, please avoid coming into the school premises
during the dismissal period. Your child/ward will meet you outside the
designated school gate.</p>
<h4>Dismissal during inclement weather (rainy days)</h4>
<p>Parents/guardians are to wait for your children/wards outside Gate 3 during
wet weather. An announcement will be made through the Parents Gateway app.
As dismissal will be staggered by level and then class, we seek your patience
in waiting for your child/ward, and cooperation not to congregate prematurely
along the sheltered walkway until the class being dismissed is announced.</p>
<h4>Guidelines on Sending and Receiving Children/Wards</h4>
<p>Parents/Guardians should pick up your child/ward from the designated dismissal
gates at dismissal time. If you send or pick your child/ward in a vehicle,
do note that the school has only one main gate for the entry and exit of
vehicles. In order to ensure the safety of the pupils, the school has to
minimise the frequency of vehicles entering the school. Therefore, please
use the <u>public car park next to HDB Blk 413 as there is a sheltered walkway to the school through Gate 3</u>.</p>
<p>The carpark provides a 10-minute grace period for drivers for alighting.
Do try to keep the alighting duration short so that other drivers can also
pick up their children. Should you require more time, please park your
vehicle at a parking lot.</p>
<p>Please note that primary school pupils will not be allowed entry or exit
through Gate 4 (Student Care only) or Gate 5 (MK@Fengshan pupils only).</p>
<h2>School Security and Safety</h2>
<h4>School Security and Registration at Security Post</h4>
<p>For security reasons, please enter the school premises via the school’s
Main Gate for and register at the Security Post.&nbsp;Please produce a
photographed identity card to confirm your identity when you register with
the security guards on duty. Visitor(s) could contact the school general
helpline at 6586 0123 to get their appointment slot before coming to school,
unless requested by respective school officer.</p>
<p>Your Identification Card (IC) must be presented for verification before
being provided a “Visitor’s Pass” from the security guards on duty.</p>
<p>Visitors may then proceed to the General Office to inform the school staff
at the front desk for their respective appointment.</p>
<p><strong>Do note that the classroom blocks are out of bounds to all visitors</strong>.
Therefore, you should not be moving around the school on your own and should
directly report to the General Office for assistance.</p>
<h4>No visitor parking and restricted visiting hours and delivery during dismissal</h4>
<p>We seek your cooperation for visitors to avoid coming into the school
premises during the dismissal timing, between 1.00 pm to 1.40 pm. Visitors
could park at the nearest public parking lots located beside school (behind
HDB flat block 413 beside school).</p>
<p>Vendor delivery vehicles will not be allowed to enter the school by security
between 11.30am to 2.00pm, as well as after 4.00pm due to school bus/van
movement for dismissal</p>
