> **Where I am, I shine forth;**  
> **Lend a hand, spare a thought,**  
> **I make a difference.**
> 
> **Where we go, we are known;**  
> **Greater than the sum of our parts,**  
> **core values make us one.**
> 
> **Fengshan’s where we discover**  
> **that learning’s never done,**  
> **that passion is a virtue,**  
> **and two is greater than one.**  
> **Through our aspirations,**  
> **all others, too, will see;**  
> **Years later, still**  
> **the Fengshan heartbeat beats in me!**
> 
 **Lyrics by Tan T’zu-Ping**

The **strokes** form the letters **“F”**, **“P”** and **“S”** – the initials of Fengshan Primary School.

The **fiery fluidity of the strokes** represents **diversity** in the expression of talents, and the school’s celebration of achievements.

The **maroon colour** captures the **passion and dynamism of the students**, as well as a **caring community spirit**, reflective of the Fengshan heartbeat.

The movement evident in the **upward strokes** portrays the **strive for lifelong learning**. Dual strokes represent unity and teamwork – the school and community working together with mutual trust and collaboration.
