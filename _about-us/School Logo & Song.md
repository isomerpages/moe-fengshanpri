<p>The&nbsp;<strong>strokes</strong>&nbsp;form the letters&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;F&rdquo;</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;P&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;S&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; the initials of Fengshan Primary School.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>fiery fluidity of the strokes</strong>&nbsp;represents<strong>&nbsp;diversity</strong>&nbsp;in the expression of talents, and the school&rsquo;s celebration of achievements.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>maroon colour&nbsp;</strong>captures the&nbsp;<strong>passion and dynamism of the students</strong>, as well as a&nbsp;<strong>caring community spirit</strong>, reflective of the Fengshan heartbeat.</p>
<p>The movement evident in the&nbsp;<strong>upward strokes</strong>&nbsp;portrays the&nbsp;<strong>strive for lifelong learning</strong>. Dual strokes represent unity and teamwork &ndash; the school and community working together with mutual trust and collaboration.</p>
