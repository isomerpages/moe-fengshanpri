## Our School Song

<p>Where I am, I shine forth,
 <br>Lend a hand, spare a thought
 <br>I make a difference</p>

<p>Where we go, we are known;  
<br>Greater than the sum of our parts,
<br>core values make us one.</p>

<p>Fengshan’s where we discover
<br>that learning’s never done,
<br>that passion is a virtue, 
<br>and two is greater than one. </p>
<p>Through our aspirations,
<br>all others, too, will see;
<br>Years later, still
<br>the Fengshan heartbeat beats in me!</p>

Lyrics by Tan T’zu-Ping
<br>Music by Cuthbert Choo

## Our School Logo

The **strokes** form the letters **“F”**, **“P”** and **“S”** – the initials of Fengshan Primary School.

The **fiery fluidity of the strokes** represents **diversity** in the expression of talents, and the school’s celebration of achievements.

The **maroon colour** captures the **passion and dynamism of the students**, as well as a **caring community spirit**, reflective of the Fengshan heartbeat.

The movement evident in the **upward strokes** portrays the **strive for lifelong learning**. Dual strokes represent unity and teamwork – the school and community working together with mutual trust and collaboration.
