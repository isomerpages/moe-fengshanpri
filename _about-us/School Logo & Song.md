<h2>Our School Song</h2>
<p>Where I am, I shine forth, &nbsp;
<br>Lend a hand, spare a thought &nbsp;
<br>I make a difference</p>
<p>Where we go, we are known;
<br>Greater than the sum of our parts,
<br>core values make us one.</p>
<p>Fengshan’s where we discover
<br>that learning’s never done,
<br>that passion is a virtue,
<br>and two is greater than one.</p>
<p>Through our aspirations,
<br>all others, too, will see;
<br>Years later, still
<br>the Fengshan heartbeat beats in me!</p>
<p>Lyrics by Tan T’zu-Ping
<br>Music by Cuthbert Choo</p>
<h2>Our School Logo</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>strokes</strong>&nbsp;form the letters&nbsp;<strong>“F”</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>“P”</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>“S”</strong>&nbsp;–
the initials of Fengshan Primary School.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>fiery fluidity of the strokes</strong>&nbsp;represents&nbsp;<strong>diversity</strong>&nbsp;in
the expression of talents, and the school’s celebration of achievements.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>maroon colour</strong>&nbsp;captures the&nbsp;<strong>passion and dynamism of the students</strong>,
as well as a&nbsp;<strong>caring community spirit</strong>, reflective
of the Fengshan heartbeat.</p>
<p>The movement evident in the&nbsp;<strong>upward strokes</strong>&nbsp;portrays
the&nbsp;<strong>strive for lifelong learning</strong>. Dual strokes represent
unity and teamwork – the school and community working together with mutual
trust and collaboration.</p>
