<p>Welcome to Fengshan Primary School and a warm greeting from the Fengshan family.</p>
<p>We are entering challenging times that require all of us to shift mindsets and brave new norms. Disruptions to our lives is now the way of life. Education has also evolved and has adapted to a world that is increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and full of ambiguity. Schools can no longer just be institutions that only impart knowledge and prepare our pupils to do well academically.</p>
<p>The past two years have been a challenging time for all. Yet, I have witnessed our staff and pupils embracing the School Values of &ldquo;Fengshan CARES&rdquo;. The resilience, tenacity and the &lsquo;Never Give Up!&rsquo; attitude shown in our staff and pupils is a testimony of what Fengshan is all about &ndash; Living the Fengshan Spirit. This Fengshan Spirit is the epitome of our school vision &ndash; Anchored Hearts, Driven Minds, Leaders of Tomorrow. It is the foundation of our belief as a school and is imbedded in the Fengshan DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Growing the Fengshan Champion</strong></p>
<p>In Fengshan, we want to nurture pupils that are grounded in values and have a sense of moral maturity that provides them with the right direction in life. We want them to navigate challenges and seek their own path, to be leaders in their own right. In Fengshan, we seek to create a learning environment where our pupils can grow in character and be the best that they can be. Through the school&rsquo;s Learn for Life Programme (LLP) &ndash; Anchored and Driven Leaders through Sports Excellence, and Applied Learning Programme (ALP) &ndash; Sustainability: Nurturing Environment Champions for a Sustainable Future, we want to continue to provide authentic learning experiences to nurture innovation and leadership in our pupils. These niche programmes, together with the school&rsquo;s instructional and co-curricular programmes and our dedicated staff and partners, develop well-rounded Champions who are leaders with a heart for others.</p>
<p><strong>Celebrating the 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Anniversary &ndash; Metamorphosis</strong></p>
<p>The school has come a long way. From our humble beginning as Hong San (Phoenix Hill) School at Chang Mao Hng Village, to moving to Bedok North Road site in the 1980s and then merging with Pingyi Primary School in the new millennium. Through the years, Fengshan continues with the culture of care for our pupils, moulding them to be loyal individuals with strength of character.</p>
<p>As we celebrate our 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Anniversary this year, we will take time to remember and commemorate the sacrifices and contribution by our pioneers and predecessors. Without their dedication towards education and laying a strong foundation for Fengshan, we can never be where we are today. Fengshan will always be the beacon in the community, providing hope and possibilities for our Champions.</p>
<p>As we continue to look ahead to 2022 and beyond, Fengshan will always be the haven for our Champions to excel and shine towards the future!</p>
