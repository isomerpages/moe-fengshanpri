<p>The present Fengshan Primary School was merged on 2nd January 2001 to
take on the challenge of bringing 2 schools (former Ping Yi Primary School
and Fengshan Primary School) together into the new Fengshan family of nearly
2500 pupils in 66 classes. The official opening ceremony was held on the
auspicious date, 02-02-02. The Guest of Honour was Mr Hawazi Daipi, Parliamentary
Secretary of Ministry of Education. Today, Fengshan Primary School has
developed into a magnificient, mega-sized primary school, one of the few
mega-sized primary schools in the East Zone.</p>
<p>We have worked very hard to forge a new identity with a strong ‘Fengshan
Heartbeat’, motivating our school community to work hard hand in hand.
‘Fengshan Heartbeat’ is the maxim we live by through lifelong learning,
continuous improvements, community service and gimping for on-going collegiality
and camaraderie in the school community. Together, we shall bring the school
to greater heights and make a difference to the lives of our young charges.</p>
