<p>The present Fengshan Primary School was merged on 2nd January 2001 to take on the challenge of bringing 2 schools (former Ping Yi Primary School and Fengshan Primary School) together into the new Fengshan family of nearly 2500 pupils in 66 classes. The official opening ceremony was held on the auspicious date, 02-02-02. The Guest of Honour was Mr Hawazi Daipi, Parliamentary Secretary of Ministry of Education. Today, Fengshan Primary School has developed into a magnificient, mega-sized primary school, one of the few mega-sized primary schools in the East Zone.</p>
<p>We have worked very hard to forge a new identity with a strong &lsquo;Fengshan Heartbeat&rsquo;, motivating our school community to work hard hand in hand. &lsquo;Fengshan Heartbeat&rsquo; is the maxim we live by through lifelong learning, continuous improvements, community service and gimping for on-going collegiality and camaraderie in the school community. Together, we shall bring the school to greater heights and make a difference to the lives of our young charges.</p>
