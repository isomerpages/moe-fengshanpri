<h2>&nbsp;<strong>General</strong></h2>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should not attempt to access data,
system and information that you are not authorised to.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are reminded that the use of learning
devices and school’s EdTech resources should solely be for the purpose
of learning.</p>
<p>[For Secondary Schools] Using your PLD</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are responsible for your PLD. In
the event of loss or theft of the device, you must make a police report
and report the matter to the school.</p>
<p><sup>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </sup>In
order to have a positive learning experience, you should ensure that your
PLD is fully charged before bringing it to school. Should you need to charge
your PLD in school, you should only do so at the school’s designated charging
stations, during recess and/or after-school hours.<a href="https://sgc-word-edit.officeapps.live.com/we/wordeditorframe.aspx?ui=en%2DUS&amp;rs=en%2DUS&amp;hid=00E9D5A1%2DC01D%2D4000%2D19E3%2D116D51FE4C64%2E0&amp;WOPISrc=https%3A%2F%2Fsgmoe%2Dmy%2Esharepoint%2Ecom%2Fpersonal%2Fmuhammad%5Ffariz%5Fmohamed%5Fzain%5Fschools%5Fgov%5Fsg%2F%5Fvti%5Fbin%2Fwopi%2Eashx%2Ffiles%2F880a864574ce4ef9ae3dea1adaa94ca9&amp;&amp;&amp;sc=%7B%22pmo%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fsgmoe-my.sharepoint.com%22%2C%22pmshare%22%3Atrue%7D&amp;dchat=1%2C1&amp;wdOrigin=AppModeSwitch&amp;wdprevioussession=ccb0bcfc%2D6a3d%2D4302%2D8f81%2D882225ee5e07%2C3ec32f4a%2De355%2Daae1%2Dd328%2D914662ee3a86&amp;wdprevioussessionsrc=AppHomeWeb&amp;wdenableroaming=1&amp;wdodb=1&amp;wdlcid=en%2DUS&amp;wdhostclicktime=1762218158370&amp;wdredirectionreason=Unified%5FSingleFlush&amp;wdModeSwitchTime=1762220278224&amp;wdPid=9DD4843&amp;wdPreviousSession=c46b3ce0-2306-485d-9f75-3121da424098&amp;uih=sharepointcom&amp;sftc=1&amp;jsApi=1&amp;jsapiver=v2&amp;muv=1&amp;uihit=docaspx&amp;pdcn=pdc5c4f#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
