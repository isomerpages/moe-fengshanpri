<h4><strong>Parent Support Group (PSG)</strong></h4>
<p>In Fengshan, we have a Parent Support Group where parents work closely with our staff in creating the best learning environment possible for our school. Besides promoting and fostering positive relationship between home and the school and serving as a communication channel for parents to provide constructive feedback on school policies and programmes, the role of PSG is also to recruit and lead other parents to join this meaningful endeavour to ensure sustainability of home-school partnership. Some of the PSG activities include: Parent Education programme, Reading Programmes, services within the school and fund-raising activities.&nbsp;Please contact the General Office (Tel: 65860123) if you are interested to join our Fengshan PSG.</p>
