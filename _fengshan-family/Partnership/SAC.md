<p style="text-align: center;">The school leverages on the collective strengths of individual SAC members as it strongly believes that their experience, expertise and leadership in various fields are valuable resources in helping the school attain its goals. We are thankful to our SAC members for volunteering their time and expertise to enhance the quality of education in Fengshan. The SAC&rsquo;s strong networks to external organisations for eg. Hong San Temple has also helped to provide scholarships/bursaries to needy pupils regardless of race. Our SAC members have shown their unwavering support by playing an active role in school functions such as Mid-Autumn Festival celebration, Teachers&rsquo; Day celebration and Year-End Concert through their generous monetary and logistics support.</p>
