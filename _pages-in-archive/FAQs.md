<h4><strong>How do I meet my child&rsquo;s teacher?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Consultation with Teachers</strong></p>
<p>You may need to consult your child&rsquo;s teachers regarding his/her progress and homework from time to time. Please call the teachers on their direct office line or email them to make an appointment before you come to school to meet them as teachers cannot leave their classes unattended to meet you. You would have received the teachers&rsquo; direct line numbers and their email addresses at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p><strong>School Security</strong></p>
<p>For security reasons, please enter the school premises via the school&rsquo;s Main Gate and register your presence at the Security Post situated near the abovementioned gate. Your Identification Card (IC) must be presented and exchanged for a &ldquo;Visitor&rsquo;s Pass&rdquo; from the security guards on duty. You may then proceed to the General Office to inform the staff on front desk&nbsp;duty&nbsp;the purpose of your visit to the school. Do note that the classroom blocks are out of bounds to all visitors. Therefore, you should not be moving around the school on your own and should directly report to the General Office for assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Guidelines on Sending and Receiving Children from School</strong></p>
<p>You are to pick up your child/ward from the designated side-gates and main gate during dismissal time. If you send or pick your child/ward in a vehicle, do note that the school has only one main gate for the entry and exit of vehicles. In order to ensure the safety of the pupils, the school has to minimize the frequency of vehicles entering the school. Therefore, please use the public car park next to HDB Blk 413 just beside the school to send or pick your child/ward up as there is a sheltered walkway to the school through the side gate.</p>
<p>The carpark provides a 10 minutes grace period for drivers to pick up and alight passengers. Do try to keep the alighting process short so as not to inconvenience other drivers who would also be alighting their children. Should you require more time to alight your child, please park your vehicle at a parking lot. On rainy days, you may drive into the school to alight your child/ward.</p>
<h4><strong>4. Can I park in the school compound?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Parking</strong></p>
<p>Our school car park has limited parking lots and they are only for staff&rsquo;s use. If you would like to come to the school to see the school staff, please park your vehicle&nbsp;at&nbsp;the public car park next to HDB Block 413 beside the school. Waiting for pick-ups and parking near the main school gate is prohibited and against the traffic laws.</p>
