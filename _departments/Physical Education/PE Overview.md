the PE/HE checklist that our department has designed. The PE/HE checklist

and their areas for improvement.</p>

<h4>Swimsafer Update for Parents</h4>
<p>1. Students participating in the swimsafer programme are to complete their
theory tests before the practical assessment at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sstheory" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/sstheory</a> to facilitate
the issuance of the SwimSafer e-certificates and that additional fields
(email and mobile) will now be required when attempting the theory quiz.</p>

issuance status will be sent to you about 3-5 days after the completion
of the practical assessment and theory quiz.</p>
