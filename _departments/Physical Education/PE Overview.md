<p>We carry out the PE/HE assessment at the end of each semester&nbsp;using the PE/HE checklist that our department has designed. The PE/HE checklist and rubrics helps PE teachers (trained and untrained) to conduct an unbiased assessment for our pupils. It also helps pupils to know their strengths and their areas for improvement.</p>
