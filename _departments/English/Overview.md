<h4><strong>Our Vision</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;Developing a passion for the English Language</p>
<h4><strong>Our Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To develop an effective English-speaking school community, incorporating
creativity and innovation</p>
<p>The English Department aims to help pupils acquire the skills of listening,
speaking, reading and writing in the language learning process. The integration
of these four skills provides pupils the opportunity to achieve proficiency
in the language in order to meet the demands of school and society and
ultimately succeed in the acquisition of knowledge for life-long learning.</p>
<h4><strong>Core Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading) is the
core curriculum which the school adopts for English Language. STELLAR aims
to strengthen childrenâ€™s language and reading skills as well as promote
a positive attitude towards learning in the foundation years. The programme
uses research-based teaching strategies and age-appropriate materials to
engage children in the learning of English.</p>
