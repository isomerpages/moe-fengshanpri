<h4><strong>Science Assembly</strong></h4>
<p>Structured assembly sharing takes place during regular slots whereby different invited speakers, groups, as well as teachers, share on vast topics related to Science. This provides an opportunity for the general student population to be exposed to the different areas and issues in Science. Such sharing not only arouses pupils&rsquo; interest and curiosity in Science, but also raises their awareness and sensitivity to these issues.</p>
<h4><strong>Budding Science</strong></h4>
<p>It is never too young to start learning Science. Integrating the Stellar themes, interesting Science concepts are put forth to our Primary 1 &amp; 2 children through interesting mass lectures, incorporating the use of lots of pictures, songs and videos. These arouse our young chargers&rsquo; curiosity and stimulate their interest in the area of Science.</p>
<h4><strong>DNAdventure</strong></h4>
<p>The P4 pupils attend the DNAdventure at the end of the year to learn basic genetics through interesting hands-on activities.&nbsp;In the process, they understand the importance of nucleus in a cell and show greater awareness about genetic materials (DNA, genes and chromosomes) that are contained in the nucleus.</p>

<h4><strong>Exploring Science: A Weekly Recess Programme</strong></h4>
<p>&lsquo;Exploring Science&rsquo; is a weekly Science programme that was introduced in 2015. Exploring Science aims to instil interest in pupils for the subject. What&rsquo;s a better way than to allow pupils to have a hands-on experience conducting various experiments?</p>
<p>At every session, students get to conduct experiments under the supervision of the facilitator and share what they have learnt. The programme, which targets the lower primary students, is conducted every Monday during recess.</p>

<h4><strong>Hydroponics @ Fengshan</strong></h4>
<p>As part of the school Green Fingers Programme, the P5 pupils are engaged in the Hydroponics @ Fengshan. This is to expose them to alternative ways of agriculture through experiential learning.&nbsp;In this programme, each class will be allocated 3-4 weeks to grow their plants using the Dynamic Root Floating Technique (DRF) System. During this period of time, students will have hands-on experience in growing a selected plant, usually green leafy vegetables. They will be involved from the transplanting phase till that when the vegetables are ready to be harvested.</p>

<h4><strong>Science Orientation</strong></h4>
<p>At the start of Primary 3, the pupils are introduced to Science for the first time. The orientation seeks to leverage on the curiosity of pupils to get them to enjoy Science and explore it.&nbsp;During the orientation, pupils are engaged in a variety of hands-on activities. For instance, they are introduced to some commonly used apparatus while they learn skills such as measuring, transferring liquids and recognizing the different apparatus in the laboratory.</p>

<h4><strong>Learning Journey to DNA Lab</strong></h4>
<p>Every year, the P5 pupils are taken on a learning journey to the DNA Lab at the Singapore Science Centre to deepen their understanding on the topic &lsquo;Cells&rsquo;. In this extension to their learning, pupils get to play the role of forensic investigators, applying their knowledge in solving a crime. In the process, they also learn to use higher order lab techniques such as micropipetting and gel electrophoresis.</p>
