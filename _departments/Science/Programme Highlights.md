<h4><strong>Science Assembly</strong></h4>
<p>Structured assembly sharing takes place during regular slots whereby different invited speakers, groups, as well as teachers, share on vast topics related to Science. This provides an opportunity for the general student population to be exposed to the different areas and issues in Science. Such sharing not only arouses pupils&rsquo; interest and curiosity in Science, but also raises their awareness and sensitivity to these issues.</p>
<h4><strong>Budding Science</strong></h4>
<p>It is never too young to start learning Science. Integrating the Stellar themes, interesting Science concepts are put forth to our Primary 1 &amp; 2 children through interesting mass lectures, incorporating the use of lots of pictures, songs and videos. These arouse our young chargers&rsquo; curiosity and stimulate their interest in the area of Science.</p>
<h4><strong>DNAdventure</strong></h4>
<p>The P4 pupils attend the DNAdventure at the end of the year to learn basic genetics through interesting hands-on activities.&nbsp;In the process, they understand the importance of nucleus in a cell and show greater awareness about genetic materials (DNA, genes and chromosomes) that are contained in the nucleus.</p>

<h4><strong>Exploring Science: A Weekly Recess Programme</strong></h4>
<p>&lsquo;Exploring Science&rsquo; is a weekly Science programme that was introduced in 2015. Exploring Science aims to instil interest in pupils for the subject. What&rsquo;s a better way than to allow pupils to have a hands-on experience conducting various experiments?</p>
<p>At every session, students get to conduct experiments under the supervision of the facilitator and share what they have learnt. The programme, which targets the lower primary students, is conducted every Monday during recess.</p>
