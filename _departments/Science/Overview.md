<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>An inquiring mind in every child</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To acquire knowledge, develop skills and attitudes necessary for scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>Science learning consists of the acquisition of both knowledge about the natural world and the set of skills and processes by which this knowledge is acquired and applied. As every child has a natural curiosity about the world around them, children should always be given the opportunity to inquire and explore, be it in their home environment or school environment.</p>
<p>The Science Department aims to make the journey of Science learning interesting and meaningful for all Fengshan pupils so that they will enjoy learning Science. We will work towards harnessing an inquiring mind in every child. To achieve that, it is important our pupils are equipped with basic scientific literacy so that they can make informed choices and approach challenges in a systematic and logical way. In the process of acquiring knowledge in Science, we also want to equip them with the relevant process skills and attitudes that will stay with them as they continue their quest as lifelong learners even after leaving the school.</p>
