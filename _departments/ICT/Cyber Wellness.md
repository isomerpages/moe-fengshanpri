<p><strong>Cyber Wellness Ambassador Programme</strong></p>
<p>This year, we have selected 18 Cyber Wellness Ambassadors comprises pupil representatives from Primary 4 &amp; 5 pupils.&nbsp; As ambassadors, they promote Cyber Wellness awareness within their peers and actively support Cyber Wellness programmes in our school.</p>
<p>The objective of the Cyberbullying Awareness Week is to promote the sense of awareness to the pupils in our school with regards to the importance of keeping themselves safe against Cyber bullies, the awareness of the avenues available in seeking help and most importantly on how not to turn into Cyber bullies themselves.&nbsp; Our ambassadors also attended a 4-day workshop to educate our pupils to be:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Responsible&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; Able to harness the power of the Internet with great care</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Respectful&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; Upholding others&rsquo; rights in cyberspace</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Balanced&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Astute&nbsp;</strong>in using the Internet</p>

<h4><strong>Cyber Wellness Booth Activities during Gratitude&nbsp;Week 2018</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Booth Activities &amp; Games</strong></p>
<p>The ambassadors created a number of activities and games meant to help them to educate their peers on the importance of cyber wellness. In the creation of these games, ambassadors have to integrate what they learnt and present them through the games.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The activities and games include:</span></strong></p>
<strong>Wheel of Questions</strong>
<p>Using the concept of the popular &lsquo;Wheel of Fortune&rsquo; game, our cyber wellness wheels consists of self-created questions and answers pertaining to the different main topics, examples; Netiquette, Handling inappropriate content. Players are given 2 chances to spin the wheels to answer questions before they can win a prize!</p>
<p><strong>Cyber Wellness Articles</strong></p>
<p>In their pairs, the ambassadors summarised cyber bullying related articles and came up with reflective questions. They were also required to prepare their answers so that they know how to use these real-life examples from the articles to convey important cyber wellness values to their peers. These ambassadors exhibited these case studies on the board and took time to explain their findings to their peers during the exhibition.</p>
<p><strong>On-the-spot Online Quiz</strong></p>
<p>At the booth, a few stations were setup to challenge pupils who are ready to attempt the exciting online quizzes. These online quizzes were sourced by our own student ambassadors. They also took turn to mend the stations and gave away prizes to lucky pupils who got full marks for their quizzes.</p>
<p><strong>Project Work Creation to spread the message of Cyber Wellness</strong></p>
<p>Cyber Wellness Collaterals (Digital Jigsaw Puzzles, Stickers, A-Z Handbook)</p>
<p>The ambassadors created 3 types of collaterals during the programme. The first was digital jigsaw puzzles that carried cyber wellness tips. In addition, they designed stickers that they could keep or give their friends to remind them of the importance of proper behaviour online. Lastly, they also created a A-Z handbook where each alphabet was used to form a word that was included in a Cyber wellness message.</p>
