<p><strong>Cyber Wellness Ambassador Programme</strong></p>
<p>This year, we have selected 18 Cyber Wellness Ambassadors comprises pupil representatives from Primary 4 &amp; 5 pupils.&nbsp; As ambassadors, they promote Cyber Wellness awareness within their peers and actively support Cyber Wellness programmes in our school.</p>
<p>The objective of the Cyberbullying Awareness Week is to promote the sense of awareness to the pupils in our school with regards to the importance of keeping themselves safe against Cyber bullies, the awareness of the avenues available in seeking help and most importantly on how not to turn into Cyber bullies themselves.&nbsp; Our ambassadors also attended a 4-day workshop to educate our pupils to be:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Responsible&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; Able to harness the power of the Internet with great care</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Respectful&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; Upholding others&rsquo; rights in cyberspace</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Balanced&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Astute&nbsp;</strong>in using the Internet</p>
