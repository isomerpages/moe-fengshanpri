<p><strong>E-LEARNING</strong></p>
<p>At Fengshan Primary School, we believe in helping every child find joy in learning and using technology to empower our children to learn better. Besides giving the opportunities for our students to engage in self-directed learning, HBL also aims to ensure that learning continues for students on days when school may be closed due to emergency situations.</p>
